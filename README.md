We have a happy or sad dataset which contains 80 images, 40 happy and 40 sad.
Our objective is to create a convolutional neural network that trains on these images and cancels training upon hitting training accuracy of >.999
Also, to test the accuracy of the model, we will upload real world images to see if our convolutional neural network can classify them correctly.
